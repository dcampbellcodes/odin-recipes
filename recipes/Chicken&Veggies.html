            <ol>
                <li>Add 1 cup of water to a small sauce pan and bring to a rolling boil. Once boiling add a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of butter to the water with the 1/2 cup of mixed vegetables. Bring back to a boil, cover and reduce to a simmer for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a medium frying pan, lightly coat with oil. Bring up to medium heat. Seperately season the chicken to you desire, I like to rub it down with cruushed garlic and lemon pepper.</li>
                <li>Add the chicked to the frying pan, top of the breast first. Let cook for 4-5 minutes on medium heat. Flip when the top of the breast has reached a golden brown.</li>
                <li>Once the chicken is completely cooked the vegetables should be ready. Go ahead and plate the chicken.</li>
                <li>Mix the vegetables with two tablespoons of butter, salt and pepper.</li>
